<!-- *Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended. -->

<!-- In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge. -->

<!-- # Grading Rubric -->
<!-- <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis. -->

<!-- ## Individual -->
<!-- <!-- ------------------------- -->

<!-- | Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory | -->
<!-- |----------|----------------|--------------| -->
<!-- | Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted | -->
<!-- | Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis | -->
<!-- | Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) | -->
<!-- | Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) | -->

<!-- ## Team -->
<!-- <!-- ------------------------- -->

<!-- | Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory | -->
<!-- |----------|----------------|--------------| -->
<!-- | Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki | -->
<!-- | Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) | -->
<!-- | Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis | -->

<!-- ## Due Date -->
<!-- <!-- ------------------------- --> 

<!-- All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information. -->

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

__q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below
## Your code here!
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = price, x = carat, group = 1)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Observations**:

- There seems to be a power law relationship between `price` and `carat`.
- Despite begin a continuous variable, `carat` seems pseudo-discrete.

__q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = price, x = carat, colour = factor(cut))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.45)
```

**Observations**:

- `cut` does not seem to mediate price.
    - The only caveat -- Some `fair` diamonds fall below the 'power law' curve.
- We propose that buyers look for the size of a diamonds face -- a person is willing to pay a premium for a diamond with a large face.

__EDA: Pair Plots__

As a surrogate for face size, we construct a variable, `area`, which is the product of the `x` and `y` variables.

Assess relationships between variables after adding in `area`.

```{r pair}
diamonds$area = diamonds$x * diamonds$y
select(diamonds, -c(x,y,z)) %>% pairs()
```

There's a clear linear relationship between `area` and `carat`, so we should not be surprised to find a power law relationship between `area` and `price` (as we did for `carat` and `price`.

Let's look at the regression for `price` vs `area` (with outliers removed)

```{r area}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
diamonds %>%
  filter(area > 1 & area < 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = price, x = area, colour = factor(cut))) +
  geom_smooth()
```
**Observation**: On average, higher `cut` classes seem to have better prices for larger `area` values.

**Caveat**: We removed outliers to improve this regression, but it appears that outliers are still adversely affecting the regression at large `area` values.

# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

__q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

__q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

![Terminal](./images/c00-staged.png)

__q5__ *Document* your findings in our [Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki). Work with your learning team to come to consensus on your findings.

The [Datasets](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Datasets) page contains lists all the datasets we've analyzed together.

__q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

__q7__ Add a link to your personal data-science repository on the [Repositories](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Repositories) page. Make sure to file it under your team name!
