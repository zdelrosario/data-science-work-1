*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these different variables. Unless we're careful and thorough, we can easily miss these patterns. In this challenge you'll analyze a dataset with a small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about 67% of its passengers died.

# First Look
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

__q1__ Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

```{r q1-task}
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

**Observations**:

**Variables**: `Class`, `Sec`, `Age`, `Survived`, `n`

__q2__ Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of passengers. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

```{r q2-summary}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

**Observations**:

- The number of entries in the table is 2201, while the above Wikipedia article claims 2435 passengers were on the Titanic. Why might this be the case?
    - It appears that some passengers embarked and disembarked from the Titanic before crossing the Atlantic. For example, some passengers only bought a fare from Southampton to Cherbourg to cross the English channel.

__q3__ Create a plot showing the count of passengers who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = n, fill = Class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge())

```

In absolute numbers, how many males vs. females died?

```{r q2-abs}
df_titanic %>% filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
               group_by(Sex) %>%
               mutate(total_surv = sum(n))
```
So 367 males and 344 females survived.

**Observations**:

- When comparing sexes, the absolute number of survivors is close...
- ...But the sex-wise class distribution of survivors is skewed.
    - Most adult `Male`s who survived were **Crew**
    - Most adult `Female`s who survived were **1st Class** 

# Deeper Look
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for understanding differences between groups. This is because the differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.[1]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age` group.

```{r compute-prop}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

__q4__ Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3.

Need to separate the `df` based on sex and class,

```{r q4-dr}
df_prop4 <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop4

```

```{r q4-task}
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_prop4 %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = Prop, fill = Class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge())

```

**Observations**:

- Much more telling -- most adult `Male`s died across all classes.
- In contrast, most `Female` passengers of each class survived.
    - The exception, a little under half of 3rd Class `Female` passengers survived.

__q5__ Create a plot showing the group-proportion of passengers who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don't forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider additional variables!

```{r q5-task}
library(ggpubr)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
m_gg <- df_prop %>% 
  filter(Sex == "Male", Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Prop, fill = Class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)) +
  ylim(0, 1.05)

f_gg <- df_prop %>% 
  filter(Sex == "Female", Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Prop, fill = Class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)) +
  ylim(0, 1.05)

figure <- ggarrange(
                    m_gg, f_gg,
                    labels = c("Male", "Female"),
                    ncol = 2, nrow = 1,
                    common.legend = TRUE,
                    legend = "right",
                    label.x = c(0.45, 0.35)
                    )
figure
```

What was the average survival rate for adult males?

```{r avg-male}
df_male <-
  df_titanic %>%
  filter(Age == "Adult", Sex == "Male") %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(n),Prop = n / Total) %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  summarize(avg_surv = sum(Prop))
df_male

```

For adult females?

```{r avg-female}
df_female <-
  df_titanic %>%
  filter(Age == "Adult", Sex == "Female") %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(n),Prop = n / Total) %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  summarize(avg_surv = sum(Prop))
df_female

```
For children?

```{r avg-child}
df_child <-
  df_titanic %>%
  filter(Age == "Child") %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(n), Prop = n / Total) %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  summarize(avg_surv = sum(Prop))
df_child
```

**Observations**:

- The data indicate that the crew prioritized the safety of women (74% survived) and children (52% survived). This was an [unwritten maritime rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_children_first#20th_century), and adult men disproportionately perished as a result (20% survived).
    - Purportedly, some crew emptied boats *with empty seats* into the water when they ran out of women and children to fill them, even if there were adult men who could occupy them!
- Back to the figure, 1st class passengers survived at a higher rate than lower class passengers. This effect of `Class` is most noticeable when looking at the adult female and the children sections of the plot -- while no children in 1st or 2nd class died, fewer than half of 3rd class children survived.

# Notes
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

[1] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
